summary: "Its the end huh"

For over a decade now, in the process of growing up, the one constant that has been throughout has been the existence of the school year. Every year like clockwork we had mid-terms, finals, summer holidays, winter breaks and everything in-between. Every day like clockwork I showed up to school, sat through classes, had my fun during break, and then came home. Every day like clockwork I woke up early in the morning, wore my school uniform, and went to school. 

But now that I attended my school’s fest for the very last time, I have realized that the very thing that I took for granted will soon be taken away. My time in school only has a few months left. A few months that’s going to be needed to be spent in studying for the future, and not for the fun I remember school for. 

I am currently in 12th grade, the last year of school there is. I left the above-mentioned fest’s school in 10th grade, to get a different school with less pressure so that I could focus on my studies (which I'm not really doing but I'm supposed to be anyways). But I did attend the fest yesterday and met pretty much everyone I knew in school. We took pictures, we hung out, we talked about random stuff like we used to. It pretty much was just like when I was attending the school regularly.

I really only went there to meet the select few I still had regular contact with, and just an opportunity to take it all in. I was under the impression that most people in the school forgot about me, and that most people didn't even care for me. That all got shattered when dozens of people greeted me, and we shook hands and hugged each other. Heck, even a few teachers recognized me. This was the complete opposite reaction I ever realized I would have. It almost did make me tear up. 

On the walk back to home after my friend dropped me near my house, as ironically as it was, it rained. Only in movies does it rain when the main character ponders upon something deep, walking in the night under an umbrella, and thinking about melancholy thoughts. In that moment however, I went through that (omg he is literally me). At that point did I realize that the entire day was my last stop, and now its soon time to get off the train. 

They say that school isn't the best time of your life, and even though I haven't been through all the other stages, I say that is utter and complete bs. Nothing could possibly hope to compete with these 12 years of my life I have spent. Through all the ups and downs, they're still the happiest I possibly will be, completely free, living the moments. 

My emotions are best described as music. So, there's two songs that perfectly envelop the feelings I went through writing this and the thoughts I have right now in general.

Feelings of confusion, uncertainty of the future, and the realization that I'm no longer the young, free kid I was. 

There is no going back, there is no rewind, there is no undo. This is in fact, the end of the train, and it's been one hell of a journey.
